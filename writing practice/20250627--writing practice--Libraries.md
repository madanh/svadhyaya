## 20250627--writing practice--Libraries

I like libraries.

At least here in Europe. Wherever I've gone and chosen to
visit a local library I was not dissapointed.

In Pula they have a huge kid's floor.  

In Ljubljana all the smaller libraries are cozy and cater to kids . My faculty
library's realing space is two relatively small rooms, both with a mezzanine.
It's so private I would often go there for a power nap when I was experimenting
with polyphasic sleep. The university's technical library has several huge
reading halls where students can prepare to the exam. The atmosphere there is
very conductive to work. I'd often go there to make sure I was making progress
on my freelance projects. 

In Sintra the library's floor layout is somewhat convoluted. It's built into a
rock. There are many relatively small departments but all of them are present -
complete with a music room, canteen and a full-blown garden with sculptures and
playhouses for kids if you find your way to the roof! 

In Maribor the main ilibrary is lackluster - it's situated
in an 80's (i guess) shopping mall and is spread across two floors mixed with
other businesses. But the University library! Oh my god it's so lovely. And
lively! It occupies the western facade of the uni building. Even before you
enter , chances are there will be some book event outside. And even when there's
none, there's a livelyi "Owl" cafe (Sova), book return boxes and night reading room
teeming with students outside the main entrance. So you don't even have to
enter the library to feel the vibes.
